# Content Blocking Whitelist

These files are served: https://duckduckgo.com/contentblocking/...

**Adding whitelist entries**

To add a manual whitelist entry update the top section of trackers-whitelist.txt.

**Adding new broken canvas websites**

If breakage is detected of a website due to Canvas fingerprint protection there are two mechanisms to remove the protection:

- broken-canvas-scripts.txt - Line separated regular expressions to match against scripts loaded into a web page.
- broken-canvas-sites.txt - First party pages that are exempt of protection.

**Updating the whitelist**

Run `easyWhitelist.sh`. This will update the autogenerated portion of trackers-whitelist.txt.
